## A bot to daily post good references for map design from the Internet Archive metadata on Instagram

---

### Tutorial

To build a bot that automatically posts once a day on Instagram, using Internet Archive metadata as a source, and programming with Python on an iMac, it will need to:

1. Set up a Meta Developer environment and accounts as specified, and fulfill other necessary requirements.  
2. Write a script to automate an Instagram post using the Meta Graph API.  
3. Write a configuration in a `.plist` file to schedule a trigger that runs the script and save it in the `LaunchAgents` folder on a Mac computer.  
4. Write a script to download a set of images from an Internet Archive search using their API, in accordance with Instagram's requirements.  
5. Upload and publish the resulting images in a GitHub repository.  
6. Update the first script with the actual images.  
7. Repeat steps 4 to 6 when new images are needed.

### Further developments:
- Formatting and uploading proper captions.  
- Create a `.log` file to record posted images and exclude them from the following random selection.  
- Improve the process of resizing or cropping.  
- Make a carousel post with a cropped detail as the first image and the full version as the second.  
- Automate uploading images to GitHub.
